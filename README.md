# getMetlinCode
Code used to query the Metlin database for mass and MSn data

The [Metlin database](https://metlin.scripps.edu/landing_page.php?pgcontent=mainPage) is a massive repository of mass-spectrometry data, but it can be hard to access via scripts. This repository contains code and examples illustrating a couple convenient wrapper functions I've written to ask Metlin for various bits of data and get them into R nicely.
